This is a sandbox repository for me to implement what i learn about angular. 

I started out building a sample app, which reads loto results from a csv, and displays them in graph and pie formats.
it checks for updates in the file, and the results can be filtered (thanks to T.R for the idea for this sample app).

This application is curently aligniing the existing code with the new angular 1 styleguide (see https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide), which is aligned with angular 2.

My plan is to from there upgrade to Angular 2.
